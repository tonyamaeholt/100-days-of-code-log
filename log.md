Tonya's # 100 Days of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Forked 100 Days of Code Repo, organized current weather app project files using Dropbox, Atom, and Git. Created a GitHub repo for current weather app project and set up a GitHub page for hosting my project.

**Thoughts:** The process of getting everything set up took way longer than it should and there was very little time spent on actual coding. When I did code, I felt rusty and inept. The good news is that even though it was frustrating, time flew by. I love it when I'm so engrossed in something that I don't even realize an hour has passed.
