Tonya's # 100 Days of Code - Log
### Day 4 July 8, 2017

**Today's Progress** Started a CSS image project because it looks neat. I'm using a tutorial because my skills are still not advanced enough (yet!) to do too much from scratch.

**Thoughts** My hour flew by, looking forward to playing around more tomorrow!

### Day 3 July 7, 2017

**Today's Progress** Decided to dial it back a notch and begin a static webpage to brush up on my HTML/CSS.

**Thoughts** What I was coding is really basic but I had to use some cheatsheets and I want to get to the point where I can do this (and more) from memory.

### Day 2: July 6, 2017

**Today's Progress** Used CSS to build and style a toggle switch. Wrote HTML for 3 divs.


**Thoughts:** Felt pretty frustrated that I struggled so badly with the HTML/CSS. It made me realize I need a lot more practice with it, perhaps some static webpages would be a good refresher. I will need help with the JS piece for sure. It was really fun to play around with the toggle switch though, I liked making little changes and seeing the effects (pace of translation and color morph etc)

### Day 1: July 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Forked 100 Days of Code Repo, organized current weather app project files using Dropbox, Atom, and Git. Created a GitHub repo for current weather app project and set up a GitHub page for hosting my project.

**Thoughts:** The process of getting everything set up took way longer than it should and there was very little time spent on actual coding. When I did code, I felt rusty and inept. The good news is that even though it was frustrating, time flew by. I love it when I'm so engrossed in something that I don't even realize an hour has passed.
