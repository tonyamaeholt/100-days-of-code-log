Tonya's # 100 Days of Code - Log
#### Day 11 July 17, 2017

**Today's Progress** Learning more about PHP and reading "The Joy of PHP". I used phpMyAdmin to create my first database and started building a table.

**Thoughts** I missed a day of coding yesterday because life happened. I've decided when this happens to just continue the following day but not count the day I missed as one of the 100 days. To elucidate, it could take me 105 days to finish 100 days of code. I don't have any work I did today that I can provide a link to yet. Hopefully I will soon but I'm not really sure what to expect since PHP is so new to me. 

#### Day 10 July 15, 2017

**Today's Progress** First, I finished the box animation project using transform I intended to finish yesterday. I used a tutorial and then spent a lot of time playing around with the CSS to see what else I could make it do which was fun. Then I did a star animation project using many of the animation properties to affect the background color.  

**Thoughts** Yesterday life happened and I didn't code. I was disappointed in myself but doubled down today. I realized when you have a commitment you have to accommodate for it or else it just won't happen.

### Day 9 July 13, 2017

**Today's Progress** I set up a static webpage to play with CSS animation. I learned about the transform property.

**Thoughts** Feeling low on brain energy today. Didn't spend the full hour but got something set up even though I felt like doing nothing. Frustrated that my computer got hot and bogged down at one point. No red flags on my activity monitor. Seemed fine after a restart.

### Day 8 July 12, 2017

**Today's Progress** I set up a local environment for my PHP project using MAMP. I did more reading of "The Joy of PHP" by Alan Forbes and executed a countdown timer using PHP commands as described in the book.

**Thoughts** I would like to look for another CSS art project (perhaps a CSS animation) to work on along side my PHP lessons. I liked being creative and trying to figure out how to make an image look the way I envisioned.

### Day 7 July 11, 2017

**Today's Progress** I started learning about PHP and wanted to try to implement it as I learned. Today I set up a subdomain and wrote a php file that will display the current date automatically.

**Thoughts** I'm reading a PHP book and doing this project to better understand WordPress.

**Today's Progress** I finished the coffee cup project, an idea I came up with that was inspired by the koala image project from Days 4 & 5.

**Thoughts** I had fun figuring out how to make my idea work and experimenting with different CSS properties to modify the way the end product looked.

### Day 5 July 9, 2017

**Today's Progress** I finished the koala image tutorial project.

**Thoughts** The tutorial was very helpful and the project was fun. I gained some confidence and got inspired to try an image of my own.

### Day 4 July 8, 2017

**Today's Progress** Started a CSS image project because it looks neat. I'm using a tutorial because my skills are still not advanced enough (yet!) to do too much from scratch.

**Thoughts** My hour flew by, looking forward to playing around more tomorrow!

### Day 3 July 7, 2017

**Today's Progress** Decided to dial it back a notch and begin a static webpage to brush up on my HTML/CSS.

**Thoughts** What I was coding is really basic but I had to use some cheatsheets and I want to get to the point where I can do this (and more) from memory.

### Day 2: July 6, 2017

**Today's Progress** Used CSS to build and style a toggle switch. Wrote HTML for 3 divs.


**Thoughts:** Felt pretty frustrated that I struggled so badly with the HTML/CSS. It made me realize I need a lot more practice with it, perhaps some static webpages would be a good refresher. I will need help with the JS piece for sure. It was really fun to play around with the toggle switch though, I liked making little changes and seeing the effects (pace of translation and color morph etc)

### Day 1: July 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Forked 100 Days of Code Repo, organized current weather app project files using Dropbox, Atom, and Git. Created a GitHub repo for current weather app project and set up a GitHub page for hosting my project.

**Thoughts:** The process of getting everything set up took way longer than it should and there was very little time spent on actual coding. When I did code, I felt rusty and inept. The good news is that even though it was frustrating, time flew by. I love it when I'm so engrossed in something that I don't even realize an hour has passed.
